##Grand Circus After-hours Bootcamp Countdown

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS timer project that I created.  

I created this as a series of projects called [50-JSchallenges](https://github.com/Ramona-Saintandre/50-JSchallenge)  

This are a collection of challenges that I would like to have completed by the end of February, with the goal that I have a better grasp of JavaScript.
